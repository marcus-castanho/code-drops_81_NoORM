# Code/Drops #81 - NoORM
This repository contains the final project developed in the video-tutorial "[Banco de dados sem ORM? E agora? - Code/drops #81](https://youtu.be/04-5LpqqA3Y)" produced by [Rocketseat](https://www.youtube.com/c/RocketSeat/featured) which presents a structure and practices for an application using a relational database without the use of an ORM-like tool.

## Notes
The only differences between this repo and the one presented on the video are:
- The dependencies versions;
- Some @types dependencies;
- The .gitignore file.
